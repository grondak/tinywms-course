# TinyWMS data contracts

## Inventory JSON document
TinyWMS uses one top-level JSON object containing an `inventory` array.

### Fields
- `inventory` - array of product records
- `inventory[].sku` - stable product identifier used by CLI, HTTP, and browser examples
- `inventory[].description` - human-readable product description
- `inventory[].bin` - warehouse bin or shelf location
- `inventory[].quantity` - on-hand count as a non-negative integer
- `inventory[].unit` - unit of measure such as `each`, `box`, or `case`

## Notes
- This contract is intentionally small so beginning students can understand it immediately.
- Later stages must preserve this JSON meaning unless a lesson explicitly says otherwise.
